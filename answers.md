## Input Files and Artifacts

Okay, let me start answering the questions. So for the first section about input files and artifacts, your question is can you list the exact file names you will provide? Okay, so what I'll be providing is one PDF which is called col764_underscore_assignment_2-1.pdf.

That is the actual assignment PDF. Along with that, what I'll provide are five Python files and bash scripts. The Python files will be tokenize_underscore_corpus.py, build_underscore_index.py, phrase_underscore_search.py, vsm.py, bm25_underscore_retrieval.py. These will be the Python files that attach and along with that, the bash scripts I'll just add below the prompt you give me because those are small scripts and I do not want to add them as separate files.

So those five, six files I'll just attach below. These will be the build.sh, the tokenize_corpus.sh, build_underscore_index.sh, vsm.sh, phrase_underscore_search.sh and bm25_underscore_retrieval.sh. These will be the files I give. The code files have almost everything implemented.

What I mean by almost is that they do the job that is asked of them in the assignment PDF. In case of phrase search, BM25 and VSM, they do create the output doc ID that is required. However, the precision recall calculation that is being done separately as in I have a different Python file called evaluate_IR which takes the doc IDs and then outputs.

So that is done separately. You can probably mention this that I have a separate Python file for evaluating and calculating the precision recall. For evaluating and calculating the precision recall and F1 scores later on after the doc ID has been created by passing in the qrls.json file along with the doc ID while running that evaluate file.

And it cleanly outputs the per query precision recall F1 values and then overall macro and micro precision recall and F1 values. So that's about that. Also there is one more task mentioned in the assignment which is the task 5. So basically task 0,1,2,3,4 is what I have implemented by the above files.

But I have not implemented task 5 yet which is feedback.sh. So I will implement it. Its description is an assignment medium from where you can understand it and leave the respective sections for that there only. But that is also something that I will be implementing.

So space should be there for adding that as well. 


I will not be providing you with a log and results here. You can leave spaces inside the description for each task for the phrase search, boolean retrieval and the vector space model for inputting the precision and recall values at say k equal to 200 and k equal to 20.

Okay, sorry, this is for the case of PM25 and VSM. The k equal to 20 and k equal to 200 values are for that. For the phrase search, you don't need a k, so you can simply mention the precision, recall and f1 values. So for there, there will be just one entry about that.

Along with that, so yeah, infer the missing implementations from the assignment PDF as you asked in question 2. For question 3, I have said that no logs will not be provided. But I will leave space for it in the sense that I ran for a lot of configurations for k equal to 20 and k equal to 200 and I have CSV files.

Right. Later on, I will convert those CSV files into heat maps and then explain about it. Like not explain about it, but like just attach those heat maps. So how do I want you to add this? Oh, can you ask me clarifying question about this once I give you the entire output and maybe present your own thoughts about how this can be presented in the document?

That'd be a good idea. 


## Report Structure and formatting

No, actually there is no page limit or word count. I think 6 to 7 pages should be enough but there is no specific page limit or word count. You can use as much as required to keep it specific and subside enough information, leaving space for the heat map.

Question 5: Do you have to follow a specific format? No, you don't have to follow a specific format. You don't need to do the readme, that can be done later on. Or maybe you can actually generate a separate readme just giving the instructions on how to run the code.

Should the report include a bibliography? No, there is no need for bibliography. Yeah, you can give the formulas and methods directly without giving citations. So formulas for the vector space model, for the BM25, they can be given directly.

Point to note is make sure that the formula you are giving in the report is exactly the same as being used in the Python files that I am attaching. That is extremely crucial for this to work correctly.



## Assignment Context 

The dataset used is a custom dataset that the course instructor provided us, which is based on a subset of COVID-19 documents. I think you don't need to mention too much about it. The only point is, okay, yeah, you can actually mention a bit about the corpus. Here's how you will do it.

So the name of the corpus is cord19-trec-covid-docs-a2. And in this document, basically this is a JSON-L file. And each line has first a doc ID field, a title field, a DOI field, a date field, and an abstract field. Yeah, all of these fields are present in the JSON-L file, basically JSON lines, I think.

And there are in total 1,91,175 of such documents in this corpus. so that is the information about the data set apart from that we are given around 50 queries in a queries.json file and that queries.json file we have a query ID and a title which is relevant to us basically it has a more fields which I'm forgetting the name of right now narrative and abstract I think not sure but I don't know if that is relevant if it's relevant I'll look it up and provide it to you what is the evaluation metrics required they have not mentioned the evaluation metrics they have just said report the precision recall and f1 score so what I have decided is that I'll do precision and recall and f1 at the rate 20 and 200 for vsm and bm25 and for the case of your phrase search I think that says direct reporting of precision recall and f1 right just because there's no at the rate k yeah there is no map no ndcg those are not required here for bm25 what are the exact ranges of k1 and bu tested okay I let me look that up and tell you 


I started off testing like this 

# Search space bounds
K_MIN, K_MAX = 20, 200                  # integer k (top-k)
K1_LOW, K1_HIGH = 0.5, 2.0              # typical BM25 k1 range
B_LOW, B_HIGH = 0.1, 0.95               # typical BM25 b range



Once I came back with the results, then ChatGPD analyzed it and gave me back the following response. Of course, when you do this kind of variation between Kmin and Kmax, obviously the higher value of the number of retrieved documents gives a better value. So in this run, the above run, it was biased towards a higher Kmax.

Now I wanted to find values for Kmin when you set it to 20. So I ran two separate runs. Below is the result that I got while running the above statement and then its analysis. 


What your run says (k ∈ [20,200])
Best so far: macro-F1 = 0.2201 @ k=200, k1≈1.618, b≈0.4975.
Earlier plateaus were already close: 0.2173 (k≈193, k1≈1.611, b≈0.564) and 0.2199 (k=200, k1≈1.405, b≈0.547).
Pattern: the good region is k1 ~ 1.4–1.7, b ~ 0.45–0.60.
Extremes (b≈0.10 or 0.95, k1≈2.0) didn’t help.
Is there room for improvement?
Probably a hair—think +0.001 to +0.005 at best—by zooming into that sweet spot with finer steps. You already spent many trials and didn’t beat 0.2201 after trial 46, which suggests you’re near a local (likely global) optimum for this index + qrels.
Do the two separate runs you asked for
1) Fix k = 200 (get the absolute best at depth 200)
Edit the constants at the top of bm25_tuner.py like this:
K_MIN = 200, K_MAX = 200
Narrow and zoom:
K1_LOW = 1.4, K1_HIGH = 1.75
B_LOW = 0.45, B_HIGH = 0.65
Increase trials for finer search: N_TRIALS = 80 (keep N_WARMUP = 15)
Smaller local steps to really fine-tune:
INIT_SIGMA = {"k": 1.0, "k1": 0.08, "b": 0.06}
Expected outcome: Either you confirm ~(k1 1.60–1.65, b 0.48–0.55) or pick up a tiny win (≤0.005 macro-F1).
Current recommendation (k=200):
Use k1 = 1.618, b = 0.498 (rounded from your best).
2) Fix k = 20 (optimize for your actual runtime setting)
Make a separate pass with:
K_MIN = 20, K_MAX = 20
Start with a slightly broader hyper-box (k=20 behaves differently):
K1_LOW = 1.0, K1_HIGH = 2.0
B_LOW = 0.30, B_HIGH = 0.75
N_TRIALS = 80, N_WARMUP = 20
INIT_SIGMA = {"k": 1.0, "k1": 0.12, "b": 0.10}
Why broader for k=20? With a shallow cutoff, the scoring dynamics shift—sometimes a tad higher k1 or moderate-to-higher b (~0.5–0.7) helps emphasize strong term matches and modest length normalization to clean up the very top ranks. Let the tuner decide; then you can do a second zoom pass around the best point it finds (e.g., set K1_LOW/HIGH and B_LOW/HIGH to ±0.1 around the winner and run another 60–80 trials).
Quick takeaways & settings to try
For k=200: you are already in the right pocket. Do a fine-zoom run:
Bounds: k1 [1.4, 1.75], b [0.45, 0.65]
Trials: 80
Adopt the current best meanwhile: k1=1.618, b=0.498.
For k=20: run a dedicated search; expect a different optimum:
Bounds: k1 [1.0, 2.0], b [0.30, 0.75]
Trials: 80
Then zoom ±0.1 around the winner for another 60–80 trials.



Then I came back with the results for the k=200 run that it recommended me and then I still got the following result. 

TL;DR (actionable)
k = 200 (fixed): you’re basically at the ceiling. Use
k1 = 1.618, b = 0.498 (rounded) — this is your current best (macro-F1 = 0.2201). Further gains will be ≤ ~0.003 unless you change the index/data.
k = 20 (fixed): do a separate search; the optimum will likely shift. Start broad, then zoom.
What your logs say
Best found: macro-F1 = 0.2201 @ k=200, k1≈1.6178, b≈0.4975.
Multiple near-ties around k1 ~ 1.4–1.7, b ~ 0.45–0.60.
A longer, focused sweep over k=200 didn’t beat 0.2201 → you’re at/near a local (likely global) optimum for this setup.


I ran the below results for the case of k=20. I ran the below settings. 

K_MIN = 20; K_MAX = 20
K1_LOW = 1.0;  K1_HIGH = 2.0
B_LOW  = 0.30; B_HIGH  = 0.75
N_TRIALS = 100; N_WARMUP = 25
INIT_SIGMA = {"k": 1.0, "k1": 0.12, "b": 0.10}
METRIC = "macro_f1"


came back with this 

Where you stand now
k = 200
Best: macro-F1 = 0.2201 at k1 ≈ 1.6178, b ≈ 0.4975.
You then ran an 80-trial zoom and didn’t beat it → you’re basically at the ceiling for this index/qrels.
k = 20
Best: macro-F1 = 0.0530 at k1 ≈ 1.1522, b = 0.3000.
Note that b hit the lower bound (0.30) and k1 hovered close to 1.0–1.2 → classic sign the optimum may lie outside your current box.
What to lock in (now)
For reporting / depth-200 runs:
k=200, k1=1.618, b=0.498 (rounded from the winner).
For production / depth-20 runs (until you explore more):
k=20, k1=1.152, b=0.300 (your current best).
Is there room for improvement?
k = 200: Very little (maybe +0.001–0.003). You already searched the right basin and an intensive zoom didn’t move the needle.
k = 20: Yes. Your best is on the boundary (b=0.30). That’s the strongest “keep going” signal.
What to run next (targeted sweeps)
A) k = 20 (priority)
The pattern suggests lower b (weaker length normalization) and k1 near 1 might help the very top ranks.
Stage 1 (boundary extension):
Bounds: k1 ∈ [0.80, 1.40], b ∈ [0.00, 0.40] (push b below 0.30)
Trials: N_TRIALS = 120, N_WARMUP = 30
Init step sizes: INIT_SIGMA = {"k": 1.0, "k1": 0.10, "b": 0.08}
Stage 2 (zoom around the new best from Stage 1):
Bounds: ±0.08 around the new best k1, ±0.06 around the new best b (clipped to valid ranges)
Trials: 80
If your new best still sits at b near 0, that’s meaningful—shallow cutoffs sometimes prefer minimal length normalization.
Optional add-on: If your code can do BM25+, try delta ∈ [0.2, 1.0] with the same k1/b ranges. BM25+ sometimes helps when k is small by reducing over-penalization on short docs.
B) k = 200 (just to confirm saturation)
Bounds: k1 ∈ [1.55, 1.70], b ∈ [0.46, 0.54]
Trials: 60
Expectation: mostly confirm (1.61–1.65, 0.48–0.52) as the sweet spot.
Why k=20 behaves differently
With a shallow cutoff, you’re optimizing the very top of the ranking. That often favors:
Lower b (less aggressive length normalization), and
k1 ≈ 1 (strong term frequency saturation without over-boosting).
Your run already hints at both.
Final recs to “just use the best”
Depth-200 preset: k1=1.618, b=0.498.
Depth-20 preset (current): k1=1.152, b=0.300.
Then run the k=20 boundary extension above to try to beat it; if it does, update the preset to the new pair.


More information 

🔑 Insights from the data
Best performers cluster around:
k1 ≈ 0.8–0.85
b ≈ 0.07–0.12
Your top 10 runs all live here.
Example:
Best trial: k1=0.800, b=0.0839 → macro-F1 = 0.0548 (highest recorded).
The earlier “best” (k1≈1.15, b=0.30) is actually weaker.
New sweet spot clearly shifted downwards in both k1 and b.
Precision stays ~0.63–0.64, Recall ~0.029.
So gains in F1 are small but real → due to very slight recall improvements at those parameter settings.
b wants to be near-zero: The trend suggests length normalization is hurting at shallow k, so reducing it helps.
k1 prefers sublinear TF weighting: Lower k1 (<1.0) dampens the effect of repeated term hits, which stabilizes rankings when only 20 docs are retrieved.
🎯 Recommended hyperparameters for k=20
Final preset:
k = 20
k1 = 0.80
b = 0.08
Safe range to try if you re-run:
k1 ∈ [0.75, 0.90]
b ∈ [0.05, 0.15]
📌 Interpretation
At shallow cutoff (k=20), BM25 works best with:
Minimal document-length normalization (b ≈ 0).
Mild term frequency scaling (k1 < 1.0).
This matches theory: when you only look at the very top ranks, you want to avoid over-boosting long docs or repeated terms.


Okay, ChatGPT, I think I have dumped a lot of information on you because of this, for this answer of what are the exact ranges of K1 and VU tested. So, you can ask me more clarifying questions about this before generating the final prompt, if you think so. However, it mentions all the parameters dried out and then the results got from that. 



Yeah, for the vector space model, I use DFIDF weighting with cosine similarity. I would recommend that the agent goes through the VSM code to figure this out even more clearly so that it can generate a better report. 




It's not free search. I have to answer your question number 12. It's phrase search. phrase_search phrase_search.py

## Figures and results

Yes, I already have a heat map for BM25 for the two different k values. That's the k=200 and k=20. Key placeholders for the figures. Also draft some generic captions please.

There will be two figures, one for BM25 at k=200. The heat map shows the k1 parameter and b parameter values. Just that basically. For the case of formulas just the final equation should be enough. No need to show the derivation of the final formula that is coming up. 



## Authors and Metadata

The title will be, yes, COL 764 assignment 2. The authors' names should be, leave them as placeholders. Priyanshu Agrawal, Vishakha Agrawal. Entry numbers 1 and 2, you can leave those as placeholders.

Just start with the introduction, that is fine. A date field in the title page would be a good idea. 


## feedback.sh 

For feedback.sh that is the boner task, include a dedicated placeholder section, do not title it feature work, assume it to be same as BM25 and VSM. Basically the feedback.sh is just taking pseudo implicit feedback or pseudo explicit feedback is the term where you get a first set of documents, use them to update the query and then do the vector search.

Again, the idea is to have slightly better performance than the precision recall and F1 of normal vector space model. That's the idea. So it's just one more task in the original assignment. See, right. So this will be task five that's mentioned in the assignment PDF. No future work. 


## 7. Style & Tone
No, no, don't be very concise or it should be sort of narrative academic. Use formulas where you can, use a table where you can, basically use formulas and tables wherever you can. It should be narrative academic report. But again, these feel like two very extremes.

So still narrative academic, but not extremely. Like wordy descriptions too much needed. It's still just an assignment report where you just have to tell the formula you use roughly about it and then just move forward with it kind of. 

oh no you what you can include and this is a good thing you asked for question 23 basically in the case of assumptions for task one basically use the code to understand how the assignment has been solved so in the case of like tokenized corpus what we have been asked to do is that simply take the documents merge all the fields and run the tokenizer spacey tokenizer directly without any kind of stemming or lemmatization and then that's how the report is getting created that's how the vocabulary is getting created so you can mention that as an assumption because technically it was told to us to do that but yeah it's a good idea to have like assumption there maybe 


No, no need to include hyperlinks as I'm just submitting a report. It's not that big of a deal. Code snippets, if you think, I don't think so code snippets are required here. Maybe don't include code snippets. 


## 8. Output Deliverables
The LLM should output both the report.tx and readme file. The latex should be compile ready with everything inside mentioned. So you'll just, I'll take the entire thing, paste it in main.tx file of Overleaf and run it. No, there should not be a makefile script.

I'll be using Overleaf for it.
