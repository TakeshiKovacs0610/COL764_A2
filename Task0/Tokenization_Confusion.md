There is still some confusion about the tokenization process. There's a lot of discussion going on about it on Yadza. For now, just so that my brain does not explode making all these changes, what I'm doing is, what I'd already done was I'd implemented two approaches in the earlier file, where there is a raw spacey mode and there is an A1 style mode.

The A1 style mode first removes non-Sky characters and digits and then performs the tokenization via spacey. As compared to the spacey raw method that just simply concatenates the entire text and then performs the tokenization process. So, now I have switched it to spacey raw for now. I assume that this is okay for now, but might again have to be reviewed once before final submission. 



# TODO : Confirm that what you have done is corret.
