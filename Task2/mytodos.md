Okay, my to-dos include for now going over the code that has just been written by GPT for phrase search. Read through the code once. Look at it if you feel that it is correct. Then go over the perform tests by generating outputs.

Keep in mind that this is something that can be verified with others. So you will have to do that at some point. So as a reminder to self, message other people and check their results for the phrase search part.


I need to divert my focus right now to working on this BTEC project that I have and looking into it. This is going to take a long while. But phrase search has been implemented and I don't have any priors right now, which help me better work on it because I will have to go over it once and test it out.

The logic still is there in the implementation plan, so that's fine. Okay, let's just get started on BTEC project work. What do I need to do first? Get autogen working for a similar element plan and feed it the code for the train test validation.

And then we'll run with a simple element called let's first do that using autogen.
